# Week-1-Homework---HTML-CSS

## So...
I'm supposed to write a 'quality' README file... without much knowledge in actually writing one. 

At least copying the format from the assignment README works! Well I don't know what to detail here, so I'll just jot down the changes I made to the original code here.

## Changelog:

* Tossed out all "`div`" tags in favor of more familiar HTML tags.

* Redid the **style.css** to fix the resulting mess from changing the `div` tags.

* Removed several redundancies from the **style.css**, trimming the fat down from 200+ lines to... 125 lines. Well, I tried.

* Fixed the issues that happened to the **HTML** file due to said changes.

* Added *alt* tags to all images while I'm at it.

* Added missing hyperlink target onto SEO box.

* Spent far too much time getting the website to look exactly the same as the original... until I noticed it had very little grading weight and I effectively wasted my time. ***Whoops.***

* Deployed the result on Github, learned that the Pages feature takes several minutes to reflect the changes.

* Jotted down this silly little README to document the changes.

## Website Link:
Ah yes, can't forget this website link. Here it is:

*Silently praying that informal writing doesn't decrease the grading...*
